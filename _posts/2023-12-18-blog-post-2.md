### Prepare Data


```python

# read train pickle file
with open(f'{ROOT}/train', 'rb') as file:
    train_dict = pickle.load(file, encoding='bytes')
# read test pickle file
with open(f'{ROOT}/test', 'rb') as file:
    test_dict = pickle.load(file, encoding='bytes')
# get train and test feature, label
X_train, y_train = train_dict[b'data'],train_dict[b'coarse_labels']
X_test, y_test = test_dict[b'data'], test_dict[b'coarse_labels']
print("Training sample: ",X_train.shape)
print("Testing sample: ",X_test.shape)
#number of labels
number_classes = len(set(y_train))
print("Number of classes: ",number_classes)
```

    Training sample:  (50000, 3072)
    Testing sample:  (10000, 3072)

```python
#reshape feature to image present

### Inference The Best Model on Test set


```python
# create model
best_params = {
    'model_name':df_best['model_name'].values[0],
    'activation':df_best['activation'].values[0],
    'units':df_best['units'].values[0]
}

model = MLPCIFAR(best_params)
model.load_state_dict(torch.load(best_model_name))
#optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters())
#loss function
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
#move model to GPU for faster training
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = model.to(device)
criterion = criterion.to(device)
```


```python
test_loss, test_acc = evaluate(model, test_iterator, criterion, device)
print(f'Test Loss: {test_loss:.3f} | Test Acc: {test_acc*100:.2f}%')
```


    Evaluating:   0%|          | 0/157 [00:00<?, ?it/s]


    Test Loss: 2.166 | Test Acc: 33.22%


### Diagnostics The Best Model

            images.append(x.cpu())
            labels.append(y.cpu())
            probs.append(y_prob.cpu())

    images = torch.cat(images, dim=0)
    labels = torch.cat(labels, dim=0)
    probs = torch.cat(probs, dim=0)

    return images, labels, probs
```


```python
#get predict for test set
images, labels, probs = get_predictions(model, test_iterator, device)

pred_labels = torch.argmax(probs, 1)
```


```python
#plot confusion matrix

def plot_confusion_matrix(labels, pred_labels):

    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))
    ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
    cm = metrics.confusion_matrix(labels, pred_labels)
